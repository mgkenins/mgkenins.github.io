                <b>Lambrusco dell' Emilia</b> 
                <br>August 1, 2024
                <br>Italy, lambrusco (off-dry sparkling white), 8% (vol.), 2022. Bought in Lidl, €2.29.
                <a href="https://www.vivino.com/NL/en/villa-bonaga-emilia-romagna-frizzante-amabile-dell-emilia-lambrusco-rose/w/2777852">Link</a>.

        <p>
                I must admit that I had never before deglazed a pan with sparkling 
                wine; I am glad to report that it works beautifully! However, to 
                describe wine based on its ability to become sauce is not quite 
                a testament to the taste of wine, thus no more about it. I enjoyed 
                this light and refreshing <i>8% lemonade</i> with some blazingly 
                brilliant chicken soup (credits to ChatGPT where they are due, 
                it is able to give the simplest possible chicken soup recipe that 
                turns out tasting fantastic). 
        </p>
        <p>
                The wine is certainly light; at times perhaps almost too light for 
                the taste of spirits is drowned out by bubbles desparately attempting 
                to find their way through one's nasal orifices. The bubbles are not 
                sour upon reaching the mouth, however, the wine does leave a (almost 
                lactic) sour aftertaste; it is not noticeable when partaking of the spirit 
                alongside food, and only becomes apparent when enjoying the wine pure 
                as a most barbaric knight. 
        </p>

                If one is looking for the numbing sensation of the brain, as if the 
                great folds of the cortex were being straightened and sanded out, 
                that a high alcohol concentration in the blood often brings, then 
                this bottle shall dissapoint &ndash; no such sensation is expected 
                unless the ability of the one drinking to hold liquor is so subpar 
                that they consider the following quote relatable: 
                <br>'I've heard sentences 
                in California that I've never heard before in my life. Sentences like this: 
                "Oh my God. Oh. My. God. Did you see Larry? Larry ... had four glasses 
                of wine with dinner. I think Larry ... may be an alcoholic."' 
                &ndash; Jack Whitehall. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Well, today I had 1.5 bottles. Overall quite a nice wine, would recommend 
                to accompany light meals.

                <b>Baron de Belmonte</b> 
                <br>July 31, 2024
                <br>France, merlot (dry red), 12.5% (vol.). Bought in Jumbo, €3.89.

        <p>
                For the rather meager price one expected
                a liquor that would not impress. However,
                what was poured out of the bottle was 
                a watery-looking liquid that was utter
                torture to the taste buds and moisture
                of the oral cavity. The wine managed to be
                'acid and bland at the same time.'
                The taste was really quite cheap; there were
                really no noticeable notes; or at the very least
                the sharp taste of cheap alcohol burnt through
                all notes and flavours that could have
                been present. 
        </p>
        <p>
                I have a habit that has now turned
                into an unbreakable rule that I only
                drink wine from France or Italy. This bottle
                has put to shame this tradition for the
                taste was not only down to the level of
                a wine from Spain, or not far from, Gott forbid, even
                South Africa, Chile, or Australia. 
                I could have never imagined that a French
                wine could dissapoint so much; I shudder now
                even calling it wine proper; it was closer to
                red food colouring mixed with vodka. The 
                wine had some reasonable smoothness when
                taken together with some oily crisps,
                however, that can hardly be attributed 
                to the wine, or even be thought of as being 
                in its favour.
        </p>
        <p>
                Overall, would <i>not</i> recommend, even for this 
                price. If you enjoy a wine with no depth,
                however, the cheap and trash soul
                of yours might just be the indication that
                this wine made for the proletariat
                might be just for you.
