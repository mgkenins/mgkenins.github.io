        <h3>Mathematical</h3>
        <p>
                Mathematics is probably the toughest queen one can choose 
                to tame; mathematical reasoning is at its core highly abstract 
                and the goal is to develop a highly sophisticated ability 
                to reason purely abstractly and rigorously. I believe the 
                following serve will aid well in achieving this purpose.
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        <h4>Preliminaries.</h4> While still in school, I suggest 
                        focusing on developing routine mathematical skills; you should be 
                        able to do elementary algebra very quickly and it will 
                        serve you well in the future. The best way to practice formal 
                        reasoning is via the geometry of Euclid; a very good course on 
                        axiomatic geometry is vital to train the mind (even if Euclidean 
                        geometry as such is hardly used thereafter). The Soviet school 
                        produced some of the best school literature on geometry; one resource is 
                        V. Gusev et al., <i>Solving problems in geometry</i>,
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/GusevLitivinenkoMordkovichSolvingProblemsInGeometryMir1988/mode/2up">
                            archive link</a>; another, from the American Olympiad school this time: 
                        H.S.M. Coxeter, S.L. Greitzer, <i>Geometry revisited</i>,
                        <a href="https://www.aproged.pt/biblioteca/geometryrevisited_coxetergreitzer.pdf">
                            pdf link</a>.

                        You should also learn elementary calculus; 
                        a rigorous treatment is given in M. Spivak, <i>Calculus</i>, 
                        3rd ed., <a href="https://archive.org/details/CalculusSpivak/">archive link</a>; 
                        but any calculus book will suffice &ndash; I suggest Soviet ones (or Latvian 
                        written before 2000), e.g. A.F. Bermant, I.G. Aramanovich,
                        <i>Mathematical analysis</i>,
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/bermant-aramanovich-mathematical-analysis-a-breif-course-for-engineering-students/">
                            archive link</a> (by no means the best resource). In my mind, elementary 
                        mathematics ends with calculus.
                </li>
                <li>
                        <h4>First taste.</h4> Mathematics is built on sets; naïve set theory is thus 
                        the first resource of pure mathematics; I recommend the brilliant lecture 
                        notes on set theory, arithmetic, and elementary modular arithmetic 
                        by R. van der Veen and J. Top, <i>Sets and numbers</i>, 
                        <a href="http://www.rolandvdv.nl/Sets_and_Numbers.pdf">pdf link</a>.

                        You now possess the tools to study the first real subject of pure mathematics 
                        &ndash; real analysis; a tame text that guides you through the 
                        theory and opens the gates to other maths texts is S. Abbott, 
                        <i>Understanding analysis</i>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/understandingana0000abbo_h6w9">
                            archive link</a>. This may then be easily followed by generalising 
                        the theorems about real numbers to metric spaces &ndash; sets with 
                        a distance function (metric) for any two points; an elementary resource 
                        is Sutherland, <i>Introduction to etric and topological spaces</i>, 2nd ed.,
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/metricandtopologicalspacesSutherland1998/metricandtopologicalspacesSutherland1998_144x75/">
                            archive link (1st ed.)</a>. 

                        Alternatively, you can choose to forego the separated treatment 
                        and jump straight into the metric theory (or read it immediately 
                        after Abbott / a few chapters of Sutherland) by reading the master 
                        himself, W. Rudin, <i>Principles of mathematical analysis</i>,
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofmath00rudi">archive link</a>; 
                        I find it to be a great resource for highly condensed proofs and 
                        cleaning up the theory in one's mind.

                        Real analysis for physicists is captured in the volumes of S.M. Nikolsky, 
                        <i>A course of mathematical anylsis</i>, vol. 1, <a href="https://archive.org/details/nikolsky-a-course-of-mathematical-analysis-vol-1-mir">
                            archive link</a>, vol. 2, <a href="https://archive.org/details/nikolsky-a-course-of-mathematical-analysis-vol-2-mir">
                            archive link</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                        <h4>First algebra.</h4> One of the gigantic disciplines of mathematics 
                        is abstract algebra; in my mind its study begins with elementary 
                        linear algebra &ndash; study of maps that send sums to sums and 
                        scalar multiples to scalar multiples of just the vector. If you 
                        look for a standard book, you will find the theory to consist of 
                        computing matrix products, eigenvalues, and other nasty and 
                        idiotically robotic computations; this is NOT linear algebra &ndash; 
                        it is a failed attempt of matrix theory. Linear algebra should be 
                        about the maps and not matrices &ndash; a matrix is just a special 
                        representation of a map. A fantastic resource is the lecture notes 
                        by M. Stoll, <i>Linear algebra I</i>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofmath00rudi">
                            pdf link</a>, followed up by <i>Linear algebra II</i>,

                        Some dynamical systems resource; most seem to be elementary. For 
                        engineers, linear systems and control references may be of interest.

                        <h4>Algebra proper.</h4> An aboslutely brilliant modern 
                        treatment, introducing elementary category theory: P. Aluffi, 
                        <i>Algebra: chapter 0</i>. The original treatise on teaching 
                        abstract algebra (1931): B.I. van der Waerden, <i>Moderne Algebra</i>,

                        (there are translations in English from the 2nd edition onwards).

                        Some resource on category theory. It seems that much depth lies 
                        under number theory and algebratic topology.

                        the modern editions, however, have way too many autors and have 
                        been overedited, losing both flavour and pedagogical reasoning. 
                        I suggest reading an edition no later than the 7th; little 
                        information has become outdated in the 19 years since 2005. In my opinion, 
                        the book struggles with genetics, for which I recommend
